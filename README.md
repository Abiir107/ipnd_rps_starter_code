# ipnd_rps_starter_code
In this repository you'll find the python file that contains the starter code for the Rock Paper Scissors project.

Download the `starter_code.py` file, and build your project by adding to that file! When you're done, submit your project by following the instructions in the classroom.

If you want to play with a demo of this project, download the `rps_demo.pyc` file. `.pyc` files can be run the same way as `.py` files, by using the `python` or `python3` command in your terminal, along with the name of the file. But, if you open up this file and try to read it, it won't look like python code! Don't worry, the file is fine, we just want you to come up with your own solution to the project. 
Your project does *not* have to be identical to this demo!
